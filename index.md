title:  "Share your Goals!"
---

Our principles
==============

- time is the first and the most important resource to be measured and controlled
- when your goal is shared with someone else you will gain it easier

So, don't go any furher - sign contract for working towards your goal and share it with your goal's partner

## Create new shared goal
```
/newgoal RunEveryDay 1h everyday
```

## Join 
```
/contract my /run 1h everyday
```
