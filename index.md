We believe that
===============

- **Time** is the most important resource to be measured and controlled
- When **goal** is **shared** with someone else you will gain it easier

So, don't go any furher - sign contract for working towards your goal and share it with your goal's partner

## Create new shared goal
```
/newgoal RunEveryDay 1h everyday
/newgoal MoveToHouse 3h every saturday,sunday
```

## Join others goals
```
/contract Adidas/RunEveryDay 45min everyday
/contract bongiozzo/sg 1h everyday
```

## Commit progress towards the goal
```
/commit sg 90min "Some fixes" "Finish /commit"
```
